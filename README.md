# DaftDemo

This is a simple example exercise that demonstrates the use of the Daft API.

It is a simple application that pulls a selection of properties into a List and allows a user to click on any property to view detailed information about the selected property

# API KEY

Once you get the code you must supply your own API key in the strings.xml file in the url_host_encoded value, then build and deploy the aplication.

## Things to improve

* Implement better testing, particularly negatives cases
* Implement error checking and error handling
* Lifecyle events such as onPause, onResume and onDestroy are not used because of the simplplicity of the app but should be used for saving data and clean up going forward
